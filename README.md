# dice_game

A two player dice game where you compete to see who can get to 100 points the fastest.

This dice game is made using base javascript. Its main purpose is to practice with event handlers and randomizers.

How to Play:
When you roll the dice, you get the points from the dice added to your score. If you roll a 1, you lose all the points gained and it ends your turn. You can keep the points you gained if pressed the hold button, but it ends your turn.

Hope you have fun!
